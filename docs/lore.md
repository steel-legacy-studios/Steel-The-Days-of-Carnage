# 🌍 The Legacy of Steel

> "In the age after fire and flood, only steel remains."

## The Great Cataclysm Rift

The world as we knew it ended when a massive planetary body — a rogue celestial giant — swept past Earth’s orbit. Its pull shattered the magnetic field, birthed a storm of unnatural quakes, and plunged the planet into global ruin.

This event, now called **The Great Cataclysm Rift**, shattered continents, erased borders, and reduced nations to stone-age scraps. Billions perished.

But humanity did not go extinct. It adapted.

With the guidance of **L.O.K.I.** — an ancient war AI that somehow survived the fall — humanity began to rebuild.

## A Divided Earth

Now, nearly a century later, Earth is split into two brutal superpowers:

- **The Eastern Dominion** — ruled by a single, godlike autocrat who promises order through absolute control.  
- **The Western Free States** — fragmented, democratic, messy... and unwilling to bend the knee.

Both are locked in a **technological cold war**, with steel as the most valuable resource on Earth.

## The War of Steel

Steel isn't just a material — it’s **currency**, **power**, and **legacy**. Every bullet, mech joint, railgun, and fortified bunker demands it. Every citizen, rich or poor, must serve in the military at 18.

Behind both powers lie **corporate dynasties** — wealth-drunk families who manipulate policy and profit from endless war.

At the core of this silent arms race lie two colossal particle colliders: one East, one West. Each searches for new energy. Each conducts secret experiments.

Then came... **The Calling**.

## The Drost

During a collision event involving an unknown particle left behind by the passing planet, something responded. A signal. A presence.

**The Drost** — beings from beyond our dimension — contacted both sides. They offered:

- Genetic modification  
- Disease eradication  
- Advanced AI and cybernetics  
- And whispers of the **Plasma Portal** — a gateway to their dimension

But there was a price: **open the gate**, and the Drost would offer everything.

## The Spark of War

The West, desperate to unlock the Portal first, sent a black ops unit to sabotage the Eastern collider. The mission failed... and left thousands dead.

The first shot had been fired.

Now, five years into what the world calls **The War of Steel**, every soldier bleeds for a cause built on lies and metal. Entire cities are battlefields. Tech-enhanced warriors clash in crumbling ruins. The Drost watch from the void.

Steel is everything.

## The Player’s World

You are a soldier forged in this hell — light, medium, or heavy armor.

Your gear is your lifeline.  
Your plasma weapon hums with the future.  
Your mission may decide the fate of Earth… or open a door that should never be opened.

> This is not just a war.  
> This is your legacy.  
> **This is the Days of Carnage.**
